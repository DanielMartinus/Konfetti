 * the mass is to zero the easier it will accelerate but the slower it will will fall down due to gravity.
 * @property massVariance create slight randomness how particles react to gravity. This variance
 * is a percentage based on [mass]. The higher the variance the bigger the difference in mass between
 * each particle is. Default is 0.2f for a slight difference in mass for each particle.
